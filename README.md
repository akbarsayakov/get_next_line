# get_next_line

A C function that reads any valid file line by line until the end from a file descriptor.

## what is get_next_line?

get_next_line is an individual project at 42 that teaches you how to open/write data in a file, and how to manage memory (does not contain memory leaks).

### Why would I use/try it?

The goal is to get better at C, and understand memory management. You can only use those three standard library functions:

read
malloc
free
, but you can also use functions from your personal library (libft).
